# Algorithm_Lecture
**Lecture for Art &amp; Tech**

* This git is using for our algorithm storage.
* You should commit your code in here. (it's nice to comment using // or something)
* And you can see my answer code.

There are some rules we have to keep.
* Do not be absent. If you will be absent one lecture, it will be very hard to understand next lecture and code review.
* Solve all of problems before code review. We will have a code review time for all problems before learning next lecture.
3. If you can't solve some problems, you should make question note, why you can't solve this problems. And then see my answer code, understand why answer code is like that, and make your own code.
4. Don't be frustrated. We will study hard and many problems. Maybe it will be impossible. But our purpose of this study is not solving all of problems but studying algorithm and becoming developer or programmer. The best thing you have to do is understanding, not solving. keep in mind.
5. Question through slack. Or searching through Google (not naver). It's some of ability to be a good developer or programmer.


Don't drop out.
Good luck :)
